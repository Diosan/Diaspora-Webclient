TODO.
1) Add: json paser to read pods from http://podupti.me (only https) (see https://github.com/voidcode/Diaspora-Webclient/blob/master/src/com/voidcode/diasporawebclient/SettingsActivity.java)
2) Add: Google translate button/ link to all posts (see https://github.com/diaspora/diaspora/issues/2441#issuecomment-2884673)
3) Add: Pod recognition from username handle, instead of 
choosing it from a list. Maby diaspora connect can do this. 
4) Add diaspora messages Activtiy. Make like a SMS client.
