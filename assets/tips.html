		<h2>How to format posts.</h2>
		<p>
			On Diaspora it's possible to format your text in statusmessages, comments and conversations using Markdown. This page sums up all the allowed formatting codes.
			<br/>
			<h3>Headings:</h3>
			#<br/>This is an extremely big, bold header
			<br/><br/>
			##<br/>Just as big as the one above but not bold
			<br/><br/>
			###<br/>Half as big as the ones above and bold
			<br/><br/>
			####<br/>Just as big as the one above but not bold
			<br/><br/>
			#####<br/>Only slightly bigger than regular text and bold
			<br/><br/>
			######<br/>Just as big as the one above but not bold
			<br/>
			Make sure to leave a space between the hash and your text, to avoid creating a hashtag instead of a heading. The heading ends once you hit enter to proceed to the next line.<br/>
			<h3>Lists:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>This</li>
				<li>is</li>
				<li>a list.</li>
			</ul>
			In order to create one you use *, + or - in front of the paragraphs you want to have listed. It's also possible to make numbered lists by putting '1.'<br/>
			and onwards in front of the list items.
			<ul>
				<li>This</li>
				<li>is</li>
				<li>a numbered list.</li>
			</ul>
			Again, make sure to leave a space between the Markdown and the text, otherwise it will not work.<br/>
			<h3>Code blocks:</h3>
			If you are a developer you may be interested in code blocks. To create a code block, start your text/code with "". To continue with normal text, close the code block with another four backticks ( ""). Optionally you can start all your lines of code with 4 spaces. Adding more spaces will allow for further indenting. It's also possible to display code inline, 'by starting an ending the snippet with a backtick'.<br/>
			<br/>
			<h3>Horizontal line:</h3>>
			To create a horizontal line, use at least three - - -, _ _ _ or * * *. Any number above three will do the same thing and spaces between the characters do not matter.
			<br/>
			<h3>Italics and bold:</h3>
			<b>Italics:</b><br/>*word* or _word_<br/>
			<br/>
			<b>Bold:</b><br/> **word** or __word__<br/>
			<br/>
			<b>Italics and bold:</b><br/>***word*** or ___word___<br/>
			<br/>
			<h3>Inline links:</h3>
			To create an Inline link use the following code:<br/>
			[link text here](link.address.here "alt text")<br/>
			<h3>Images:</h3>
			To add external images to your post, comment or private message, use the following code:<br/>
			![Alt text](http://website.com/image.jpg)<br/>
			The alternative text gets displayed if the image cannot be loaded; it's doesnâ€™t need to be changed specifically.<br/>
			<h3>Escape Markdown:</h3>
			If you want to prevent a character from being 'read' by Markdown, you can escape it by putting a \ in front of the character. For example, Diaspora\* prevents that the asterisk creates italic text in combination with another asterisk in the following text.
			<br/>
			<h3>Symbols:</h3>
			You can create the following symbols using a combination of characters:<br/>
			"->" = "&rarr;".<br/> 
			"<-" = "&larr;".<br/>
			"<->" = "&harr;".<br/>
			"(c)" = "&copy;".<br/>
			"(r)" = "&reg;".<br/>
			"(tm)" = "&#8482".<br/>
			"<3" = "&hearts;".<br/>
			"x^2" = "x&sup2;".
